# ⚙️ How to Use

<h3>
	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg" width=20/> &nbsp;Install the VSCode extension</p>
</h3>

You can install our VSCode extension [Origins Mod JSON Schemas](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SnaveSutit.origins-mod-helper) to get automatic schema validation and autocompletion.

<h3>
	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/IntelliJ_IDEA_Icon.svg" width=20/> &nbsp;Add the JSON schemas to IntelliJ IDEA</p>
</h3>

Follow the steps outlined in the [IntelliJ IDEA documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html) to add the JSON schemas to your project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> IntelliJ IDEA appears to have issues when using our schemas. (See issue #19)
> Validation, and autocompletion may not work as expected, or at all.

### 🎯 Directly in your JSON files

When writing a JSON File, you can add the following field to the top of each JSON file to enable schema validation in most editors:

- For Origins (`data/namespace/origin/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/apoli/origin.json"
  ```

- For Powers (`data/namespace/power/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/apoli/power.json"
  ```

- For Global Powers (`data/namespace/global_power/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/apoli/global_power.json"
  ```

- For Origin Layers (`data/namespace/origin_layer/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/apoli/origin_layer.json"
  ```

- For Skill Trees (`data/namespace/skill_tree/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/apoli/skill_tree.json"
  ```
  ⚠️ Requires the [Skillful](https://skillful-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) mod to be installed!

- For Sync Keybinds (`data/namespace/keybinds/`):

  ```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/refs/heads/schemas/sync/keybind.json"
  ```
  ⚠️ Requires the [Sync](https://modrinth.com/mod/sync) mod to be installed!

> [!TIP]
> Building a tool that loads these schemas from **local files** rather than over HTTP (e.g. a VS Code extension bundling them via `contributes.jsonValidation`)? Use the self-contained versions under [`schemas/bundled/`](https://github.com/SnaveSutit/origins-mod-json-schemas/tree/schemas/bundled) instead of the per-file schemas elsewhere in the `schemas` branch. VS Code's local (`file://`) schema resolver has a longstanding bug where relative `$ref`s between files resolve against the wrong directory once a schema has more than ~10 `allOf`/`if`-`then` branches - the bundled files avoid that entirely by inlining everything into one file per entry point.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

### 💻 Setting up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Open the repository in VSCode
3. Run `yarn install`

### 🛠️ Making Changes

1. Make your changes to the JSON schemas in the `src` folder.
1. Run `yarn dev` - This will start a watcher that will automatically build the schemas when you make changes.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The built schemas are put into the `schemas` folder. You should not make changes to the files in this folder directly, as they will be overwritten by the build process.

1. Assuming you are using VSCode, you can press `F5` to open a new window with the extension loaded.

   - This will allow you to test the schemas while you make changes. You can restart the window by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1` and typing `Developer: Reload Window`.

### 🔀 Creating a PR

Once you are happy with your changes, commit them and open a pull request and assign it to `SnaveSutit`.
